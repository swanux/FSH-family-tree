## Family

> `families` (Family[])<br>
> `families[].families` (Family[])

  - parents: [Lisa, Milhouse]
    children: [Zia]
```

A typical family has `parents` and `children`, but only one is required. Every family must have at least one or more of the required properties defined (`parents`, `parents2`, `children`, `children2`).
